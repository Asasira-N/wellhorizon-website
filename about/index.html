  <!-- 📖 Our Story -->
  <section class="about-section fade-in">
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      WHRI was founded by Kanyesigye Amon, an Environmental Health Scientist inspired by deep Christian conviction and a lifelong burden to heal preventable suffering.
      Raised as the son of a Seventh-day Adventist pastor, Amon grew up witnessing both the spiritual hunger and health challenges affecting communities. His early dream was to become a medical doctor, but God redirected his path to the Makerere University School of Public Health, where he graduated with a degree in Environmental Health Science.
      Here he won his first $1,000 research grant (HEPI-SHSSU, 2023) for <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41179550/">a study on Sickle Cell Disease awareness among university students</a>.
      This experience ignited a passion to build a research-driven ministry that blends science, compassion, health education, and spiritual truth.
      This vision crystallized in 2024 to 2025 when Amon and the team launched the WellHorizon Research Initiative, which was formally registered on 26 March 2025 and now stands as a fast-growing Christian research and health organization.
